# ðŸ•¹ Reaction Time Tester

A simple browser game that measures your reflex speed.  
Built as one of my earliest projects to practice **JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling**.

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Click "Start" and wait for the screen to change color.
2. As soon as it changes, click as fast as you can.
3. The app records your reaction time in seconds.
